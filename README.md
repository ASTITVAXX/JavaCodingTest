**Multi-Camera Image Stitching Coding Test**
**Problem Statement:**
**Objective:** Develop a Java application using OpenCV to stitch images from multiple cameras into a single panoramic view.

**Background:** In various applications, panoramic photography, and surveillance systems, multiple cameras are used to capture different segments of a larger scene. The challenge is to seamlessly integrate these overlapping images into a single comprehensive view.

**Task:** You are provided with images from two different cameras, each capturing overlapping sections of a scene. Your task is to implement the necessary image processing algorithms to stitch these images together into one continuous panoramic image.

**Requirements**
**Implement the stitching module:** Develop the logic to align and merge multiple images into a single panoramic image.
**Handle errors and discrepancies:** The program should gracefully handle potential alignment issues and discrepancies in image overlap.
**Optimize performance:** Ensure that the solution is efficient and can process images in a reasonable timeframe without excessive resource consumption.
**Setup Instructions**
**Environment Setup:**
Ensure you have Java JDK and OpenCV installed on your system. Refer to OpenCV Installation Guide for detailed installation instructions. Set up your Java environment to include the OpenCV library.
**Repository Structure:**
src/ImageStitcher.java: This is the main Java file where you will implement your stitching logic.
images/: This directory contains sample images for testing your application.
**Compilation and Execution:**
Compile the Java code with the following command:
bash
Copy code
javac -cp path/to/opencv-xxx.jar ImageStitcher.java
Run the compiled program with:
bash
Copy code
java -cp .:path/to/opencv-xxx.jar ImageStitcher
Expected Output
The output should be a single image file named panorama.jpg saved in the root directory of the project.
The stitched image should show a seamless merging of the input images without visible overlaps or artifacts.
Evaluation Criteria
Correctness: The final image should correctly represent a panoramic view of the input images.
Code Quality: The code should be well-organized, commented, and easy to read.
Error Handling: The application should handle edge cases such as non-overlapping images gracefully.
Submission Instructions
Ensure your final submission includes the modified ImageStitcher.java file and any additional scripts or resources used.
Comment your code adequately to explain your implementation and decisions.
Submit your project as a zip file or provide a link to your GitHub repository.
